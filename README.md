# Loan_Prediction_Data_Preparation

**How It Works**

**Data Preprocessing**
**Loading Data**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.

**Data Cleaning**: Missing values are handled, and irrelevant features are removed.

**Feature Engineering**: Features are transformed and scaled appropriately.

**Model Training**


**Splitting Data**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

**Model Selection**: Various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) are evaluated.

**Training**: The chosen model is trained on the training set.

**Model Evaluation**


**Testing**: The trained model is tested on the testing set.

**Metrics**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.

**Making Predictions**:The trained model is used to make predictions on new loan applications, outputting whether each application is likely to be approved or not.


**Explanation of This Project**
This Loan Prediction project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the approval of loan applications based on applicant data. The process involves data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data, followed by training a machine learning model using a labeled dataset. The model is then evaluated for its performance and used to make predictions on new data.

The project demonstrates the application of various machine learning concepts, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It also highlights the importance of feature engineering and model selection in building a robust predictive system.

By automating the loan approval process, this project aims to reduce manual efforts, minimize errors, and provide a more efficient way for financial institutions to handle loan applications.
